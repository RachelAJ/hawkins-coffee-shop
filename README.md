# hawkins-coffee-shop

Created a fictional coffee shop based off of the Netflix show Stranger Things. The following are the requirements I chose to meet:

Used Flexbox to rearrange 2 or more content areas on the page such as the Navigation Menu, the About Article Columns section, and the Coffee Menu Gallery section. The responsive design makes user experience easier to view on mobile and desktop versions.

Used media queries to switch the About Article Columns section from a one column layout to 3 columns on a desktop layout, the Coffee Menu Gallery section from a single column layout to a 4 column desktop layout, and in the Navigation Menu from a single row desktop layout to a stacked column in mobile view.

Created an HTML form that uses Javascript to validate the Name and Email input fields and changes the submit button text to show successful submission. Using Javascript buttonClick function and "if" statements, the customer is not able to submit the form until both fields are filled out and the email field is in the correct a@b.com format. If Name is not filled out or Email format is incorrect, there will be a red box that pops up around the fields alerting the customer and will not submit until corrected. If successful, the form button will change text.

Used the :nth child CSS style to change the About Article Columns section background colors. (First column white, second black, third white)

Also inlcuded are some animations using CSS psuedo class selectors such as hovering over the Navagation Menu and hovering over the Coffee Menu Gallery section which changes size and adds some color to the background. 

Clicking on the Navigation Menu will take you to the correlating section on the page.
